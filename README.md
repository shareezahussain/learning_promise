# learning_promise

Fashionista, who favourite color is pink, won't it be a cool to have one place that you can go so you can see everything that's pink?

in order to run this application on your machine 
run npm install

I consume the shopstyle collective app api to build an everything pink app - ouputting pink fashion items.

Technologies  I've used

(1) Parcel 
(2) ES6 js - promise, arrow functions etc
(3) I have also used Git-crypt for encrpted secret key on Github

I also worked with Pagination with APIs
